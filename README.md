# COVID-19 Data Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains code and analysis for analyzing COVID-19 data from various countries, focusing on trends in cases and deaths, population comparisons, modeling, and predictions.

## Data Description

The data used for analysis is sourced from the Johns Hopkins University's COVID-19 dataset, available on their GitHub repository.

## Analysis Steps

**Data Import**: The COVID-19 data is imported and cleaned for analysis.

**Population Comparison**: Countries with the smallest and largest populations are compared to understand the impact of COVID-19.

**Trends Analysis**: Trends in COVID-19 cases and deaths are analyzed, with a focus on countries like China.

**Modeling**: A predictive model is developed to explain deaths per population based on cases per population.

**Predictions**: Predictions for future cases and deaths are made using the developed model.

**Bias Considerations**: Potential biases in the analysis, such as testing bias and confirmation bias, are acknowledged and discussed.
